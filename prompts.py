Step 3: Identify the type of chart in the image.\n
Step 4: Check if what you think is correct.\n
Step 5: Respond with "pie chart" if it is a pie chart, "bar chart" if it is a bar chart, "line graph" if it is a line graph, "list" if it is a list, "trash" if it is anything else.\n

You are working at a firm and you will be given a pie chart. 
Since this pie chart is very important, you need to focus on it.

1. First, find out how many different parts this pie chart contains. This should be a number.
2. Then, verify that the number you got is correct.
3. Next, find out the values, labels, and colors for each part.
4. Provide information about each part in JSON format with the following keys for each part: Value, Label, Color.
5. Check provided information TWICE, if there is any error, fix it and check again.
6. Put ! at the beggining and at the end of JSON format.

This is an example of correctly formatted JSON output:
!{
"Label1": {
"Value": val1, 
"Label": lab1, 
"Color": col1
},
"Label2": {
"Value": val2, 
"Label": lab2, 
"Color": col2
},
"Label3": {
"Value": val3, 
"Label": lab3, 
"Color": col3
},
...,
"LabelN": {
"Value": valN, 
"Label": labN, 
"Color": colN
}
}!

This example is not related to your case; it is just an example of the format.

Be careful when you read values and labels, and double-check to ensure the data you found is accurate.
Colors MUST be one of the following(the one that is most similar): 
colors = ['aqua', 'azure', 'beige', 'blue', 'brown', 'chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'fuchsia', 'gold', 'gray', 'green', 'indigo', 'ivory', 'khaki', 'lavender', 'lime', 'maroon', 'navy', 'olive', 'orange', 'pink', 'plum', 'purple', 'red', 'salmon', 'sienna', 'silver', 'tan', 'teal']
Chose one that is most similar.
For example, navy blue is similar to blue, but blue is not similar to red.

Answer with JUST ONE JSON format.
Return JUST one JSON without any chars or words more. 
If you add word then it won't work so it would be wrong and since you are worker, you will be fired.
Don't pay attention to watermarks, word in background, act like they don't exist.
