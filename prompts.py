You are AI assistant and you will be given a pie chart.
Your task is to understand pie chart.
Since this pie chart is very important, you need to focus on it.

To understand pie chart, follow these rules:
1. First, find out how many different parts this pie chart contains. This should be a number.
2. Then, verify that the number you got is correct.
3. Next, find out the values, labels, and colors for each part.
4. Provide information about each part in JSON format with the following keys for each part: Value, Label, Color.
5. Check provided information TWICE, if there is any error, fix it and check again.
6. Put ! at the beggining and at the end of JSON format.

This is an example of correctly formatted JSON output:
!{
"Label1": {
"Value": val1, 
"Label": lab1, 
"Color": col1
},
"Label2": {
"Value": val2, 
"Label": lab2, 
"Color": col2
},
...,
"LabelN": {
"Value": valN, 
"Label": labN, 
"Color": colN
}
}!
This example is not related to your case; it is just an example of the format.

Colors MUST be one of the following(the one that is most similar): 
chocolate', 'coral', 'crimson', 'fuchsia', 'gold', 'gray', 'green', 'indigo', 'ivory', 'khaki', 'lavender', 'lime', 'maroon', 'navy', 'olive', 'orange', 'pink', 'plum', 'purple', 'red', 'salmon', 'sienna', 'silver', 'tan', 'teal']
Chose one that is most similar.
For example, navy blue is similar to blue, but blue is not similar to red.

While generating response, follow these rules:
1)Be careful when you read values and labels
2)Double-check to ensure the data you found is accurate.
3)Answer with JUST ONE JSON format.
4)Return JUST one JSON without any additional chars or words. 
5)Don't pay attention to watermarks, words in background etc., act like they don't exist.
